Shuffle is a simple, Python-based name randomizer designed to support traditional classroom discussions.

### Author Notes
*I made this when I was in highschool and this was actually used by one of my teachers at that time. This was the time when LLMs weren't really a thing (or at least, not developed enough to be used by the general public), so I had to learn the Tkinter library and consult to StackOverflow when needed lol.*
